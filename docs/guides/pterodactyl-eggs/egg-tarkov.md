# **SPT/FIKA Tarkov Egg**

SPTarkov (Single Player Tarkov) and FIKA Tarkov are modified versions of the popular game Escape from Tarkov, designed to provide a single-player experience. These mods allow players to enjoy the intense and immersive gameplay of Tarkov without the need for an internet connection or interaction with other players online.

- **SPTarkov** focuses on replicating the full game experience in a single-player environment, offering the same maps, missions, and AI opponents as the original game.
- **FIKA Tarkov** is another popular mod that enhances the single-player experience by adding custom features, balancing changes, improved AI behavior and most of all COOP.

Both mods aim to bring the challenging and tactical gameplay of Escape from Tarkov to solo and COOP players, making it accessible for offline play and providing a sandbox environment for practice and enjoyment.
